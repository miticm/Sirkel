# Team 27: Project Charte

## Team Members:
* Elijah Smith
* Dan Hipskind
* Adam Lula 
* Tianchi Xu
* Trevor Neidlinger

## Problem Statement:
While Purdue boasts more than 1000 clubs and student organizations,  there still is no easy way to navigate them. Sure, there are platforms to find these clubs (BoilerLink, Facebook groups, club fairs, etc.), but these all lack a sophisticated way to find the organizations they would be most interested in. Furthermore, with over 30,000 undergrads it can be overwhelming, for Freshmen in particular, to find individuals who share their interests (potentially obscure enough for there to not be a club already). While plenty of students find their group at Purdue, there are still many that don’t and that’s a substantial reason for many students to dropout.

## Project Objectives:
Gather information from users and organizations to facilitate matching.
Gather basic club and organization information from a purdue database (or potentially a web scraper?).
Rank and recommend organizations to the user.
Create friend recommendations for users based on interests and personality.
Create a basic line of communication for users and organizations.
Create a filtered feed of activities for each user based on interests.
Allow organizations to reach out and find members that may be interested in them.

## Stakeholders:
* Project Owners: Elijah Smith, Dan Hipskind, Adam Lula, Tianchi Xu, and Trevor Neidlinger
* Developers: Elijah Smith, Dan Hipskind, Adam Lula, Tianchi Xu, and Trevor Neidlinger
* Users: Students (Freshmen in particular) and Clubs/Organizations of Purdue
* Project Coordinator: Lakshay Kharbanda

## Project Deliverables:
* Matching algorithm that will match users with organizations and other students of Purdue based upon interests, personality, and other   biographical features.
* A web application using ReactJS for the user interface.
* NodeJS with Express backend web application.
* MongoDB to store user and organization information.
* PassportJS supported authentication to keep user credentials safe.
* An activities feed for users supported by Redis.
